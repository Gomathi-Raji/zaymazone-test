## Admin Panel Access

The new admin can now:
- Login to the admin panel at `/admin`
- Access all CRUD operations for Products and Artisans
- View admin statistics and dashboard
- Manage users and orders

## Frontend Integration

The admin panel will automatically work with the new credentials:
- Login form accepts the new email/password
- JWT authentication handles admin role verification
- All admin components will function normally
- CRUD operations for products and artisans are fully operational

## Next Steps

1. Update any demo scripts or documentation to use new credentials
2. Consider removing the old admin user if no longer needed
3. Test admin panel functionality through the web interface
4. Update any hardcoded credentials in test files

## Security Notes

- Password is properly hashed with bcrypt (salt rounds: 10)
- JWT tokens expire in 15 minutes for security
- Refresh tokens valid for 30 days
- All admin routes protected with requireAuth and requireAdmin middleware
