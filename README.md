## 📌 Roadmap

1. **Phase 1**: UI & Frontend Development
2. **Phase 2**: Backend APIs (authentication, product, artisan management)
3. **Phase 3**: Payment gateway integration
4. **Phase 4**: Performance optimizations and SEO

## Security Hardening

Client-side measures added:
- HTTPS enforcement in production via `enforceHttpsInProduction()` in `src/lib/security.ts`.
- Input validation and sanitization using Zod schemas and `sanitizeObject()` for auth and forms.
- Basic client-side rate limiting for sensitive actions (`ClientRateLimiter`).
- Optional client-side request logging using `logEvent()` with `VITE_LOG_ENDPOINT`.
- Dev CORS tightened in `vite.config.ts` to localhost origins only.

Server-side requirements (implement on your API/backend):
- Rate limiting: Apply IP/user-based throttling (e.g., 5/min for auth) using Redis token bucket or sliding window.
- Input validation: Re-validate all inputs server-side with the same schemas.
- CORS: Restrict `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to your production domains, disallow `*` with credentials.
- Password hashing: Use bcrypt (work factor 10-12) or Argon2. Never store plaintext passwords.
- HTTPS: Terminate TLS at CDN/load balancer and redirect HTTP→HTTPS.
- API keys: Store in a secrets manager, rotate at least quarterly. Support overlapping validity during rotation.
- Logging/monitoring: Centralize request logs (status, latency, user/IP), add alerting for spikes and auth failures.

Environment variables:
- `VITE_LOG_ENDPOINT` (optional) — endpoint that accepts JSON logs via Beacon.
- `VITE_API_URL` — backend API base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:4000`).

## Backend API (Express + MongoDB)

Run locally:
- Install deps: `npm install --prefix server`
- Create `server/.env` (see variables below)
- Start API: `npm run dev --prefix server` (default `http://localhost:4000`)

Env vars (`server/.env`):
- `PORT=4000`
- `MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/zaymazone`
- `JWT_SECRET=change-me`
- `CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8080`

Endpoints:
- Auth: `POST /api/auth/signup`, `POST /api/auth/signin`
- Products: `GET /api/products`, `GET /api/products/:id`, `POST|PUT|DELETE` (auth required)
- Artisans: `GET /api/artisans`, `GET /api/artisans/:id`, `POST|PUT|DELETE` (auth required)
- Orders: `GET /api/orders/my-orders`, `GET /api/orders/:id`, `POST /api/orders`, `PATCH /api/orders/:id/cancel`
- Payments: `POST /api/payments/create-order`, `POST /api/payments/verify`, `GET /api/payments/order/:orderId/status`
- Images: `POST /api/images/upload` (auth required)
- Firebase Auth: `POST /api/firebase-auth/sync`, `PATCH /api/firebase-auth/profile`

Notes:
- Server applies Helmet, CORS, rate limiting, and logging.
- Ensure MongoDB is running locally or update `MONGODB_URI`.
- For production, set `VITE_API_URL=https://zaymazone-backend.onrender.com` in `.env`.

### Real-Time Dashboard Integration

The dashboard (`/dashboard`) now connects to the live backend API for real-time data:
- **Profile Management**: Edit name, phone, address, and upload avatar via `PATCH /api/firebase-auth/profile`.
- **Orders**: View orders with polling every 30s; cancel orders; initiate payments.
- **Payments**: "Pay Now" redirects to Zoho payment URL; payment status updates in real-time.
- **Order Details Modal**: Shows full order info with payment status polling every 10s.

Environment Variables:
- `VITE_API_URL=https://zaymazone-backend.onrender.com/` (production backend)
